1,3,"Your company's eCommerce site has noticed an increase in malicious traffic and behavior. The site is hosted in a public subnet in a VPC on EC2 instances behind an Internet Gateway and a Resolver DNS Firewall.  Your boss has asked you to create a solution that can detect and respond to suspicious requests. As a Solutions Architect, how could you automatically block suspicious DNS activity using the Resolver DNS Firewall?","Configure AWS GuardDuty to scan VPC Flow Logs in the site's PC and detect suspicious DNS communication. Send the findings to Security Hub and publish them to EventBridge. Next, create a Step Functions state machine that will kick off with the EventBridge event. The first Lambda in the State Machine should retrieve the suspicious domains and add them to the DynamoDB table used for the DNS Firewall if they are not already present. The next Lambda in the State Machine will block traffic if necessary, then notify appropriate users of the failure/success of the remediation.  ","Create a Step Functions State Machine. The first Lambda in the State Machine should analyze each DNS request and identify if it is suspicious, then add them to the DynamoDB table used for the DNS Firewall if they are not already present. The next Lambda in the State Machine will block traffic if necessary, then notify appropriate users of the failure/success of the remediation.  ",Use Amazon EventBridge Events to detect DNS requests that are not from authorized IP addresses. Create a Lambda function that will query the DynamoDB table used for the DNS Firewall and block traffic if necessary.,"Configure AWS Inspector to scan VPC Flow Logs in the site's PC and detect suspicious DNS communication. Send the findings to Security Hub and publish them to EventBridge. Next, create a Step Functions state machine that will kick off with the EventBridge event. The first Lambda in the State Machine should retrieve the suspicious domains and add them to the DynamoDB table used for the DNS Firewall if they are not already present. The next Lambda in the State Machine will block traffic if necessary, then notify appropriate users of the failure/success of the remediation.  ",3,"The best way to address this issue is to use AWS GuardDuty in tandem with the existing DNS Firewall. Lambda functions will have to be written to automate the solution by adding any suspicious DNS requests to the firewall's route table in DynamoDB, then blocking the request and notifying the appropriate party.

2,3,"Your company uses a hybrid cloud model that includes:An on-premises networkA company-wide AWS Organization that contains:An OU for Prod, Test, and Dev accounts (OU-1)An OU for Logs, Audits, and. Monitoring (OU-2)An OU with all metadata and data processing (OU-3)Account2 in OU-3 contains an RDS database in a private VPC that needs to be accessed by both the on-premises network and by users in all AWS accounts within the Organization. Your boss does not want to use VPC peering. How can you best provide appropriate access to the RDS database in Account2 in a secure and scalable manner?","Create VPC endpoints in all VPCs that will access the database from on-premises and accounts in OU-1, OU-2, and OU-3. Place a Network Load Balancer in front of the RDS instance in Account2. Employ AWS PrivateLink in the private VPC in Account2. Route database traffic to PrivateLink via VPC endpoints. Use PrivateLink to establish a connection with the NLB, which will then forward the connection to the RDS primary instance.

",1,"To securely provide access to this RDS instance without the use of VPC peering, you should utilize VPC endpoints in tandem with PrivateLink and a Network Load Balancer. The Amazon RDS connection route workflow is as follows:A. Database users or applications connect to Amazon RDS using VPC endpoints.B. The endpoints establish the user connection to VPC endpoint services (AWS PrivateLink) in other VPCs.C. The VPC endpoint services establish the connection request to the Network Load Balancer.D. The Network Load Balancer forwards the connection to the RDS primary instance."
3,3,You’re in charge of a three-tier application running on EC2 instances with a DynamoDB database. Your team currently uses a third-party vulnerability management tool to provide actionable insight into your infrastructure’s security risks.Your third-party vulnerability tool has reported some EC2 instances that have not been patched to the correct version. You have been asked to come up with a solution that automates the process of patching managed nodes with both security-related and other types of updates.Which of the following infrastructure solutions would automate the process of patching managed nodes with both security-related and other types of updates? ,Use the patch manager feature of AWS Systems Manager to automate the process of patching instances with both system and security-related updates. ,Create a service action in AWS Service Catalog to automate the process of patching instances with both system and security-related updates.,Use the service map feature in AWS X-Ray to schedule and automate the process of patching instances with both system and security-related updates.,Create a job in AWS Batch to automate the process of patching instances with both system and security-related updates.,1,"AWS Systems Manager has a patch manager feature that can be used to automate the process of patching managed nodes with both security-related and other types of updates. You can use Patch Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and applications. Patch Manager provides options to scan your managed nodes and report compliance on a schedule, install available patches on a schedule, and patch or scan targets on demand.The remaining choices are incorrect for the following reasons:● AWS Service Catalog is primarily used to allow organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. AWS Service Catalog does not allow you to automate the process of patching instances with both system or security-related updates.● AWS X-Ray is used to help developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. AWS X-Ray is not used to automate the process of patching instances with both system or security-related updates.● AWS Batch can be utilized to help you to run batch computing workloads of any scale.AWS Batch is not used to automate the process of patching instances with both system or security-related updates."

Account owner A has created a condition using the s3:x-amz-grant-full-control condition key, which requires the request from account owner B to include the x-amz-full-control header granting account owner A full control of the objects uploaded. The policy does not allow account owner B to request full control over the objects, grant full control over objects in the example bucket to account owner B, or allow account owner B maintains full control over objects uploaded to the example bucket."
